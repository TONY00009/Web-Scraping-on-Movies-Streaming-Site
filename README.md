# Web-Scraping-on-Movies-Streaming-Site

Here I've Scrapped the site: https://www.justwatch.com/in/movies?release_year_from=2000
It is an Online Movies and TV shows streaming site with all the data like runtime, IMDB rating, streaming platforms for particular movies or show
I've scraped most of the details related to a movie or show, created a data frame for both, performed a little data cleaning, and basically did a little EDA on this extracted data.
